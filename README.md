This project taught me basic java skills including all necessary information surrounding methods, constructors, classes and fields.
I discovered which constructors can take arguements and which of those arguements can be applied to fields. Finally I learned how to code a Drone application which not only utilises 2D positioning but also stores a record of their current position.
